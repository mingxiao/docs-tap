# Workload types

Tanzu Application Platform allows you to quickly build and test applications regardless of your familiarity with Kubernetes.
You can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container with a URL.
You can also use supply chains to build applications that process work from a message queue,
or provide arbitrary network services.

A workload allows you to choose application specifications, such as
repository location, environment variables, service binding, and so on.
For more information about workload creation and management, see
[Command Reference](../cli-plugins/apps/command-reference.md).

Tanzu Application Platform supports a range of workload types,
including scalable web applications (`web`), traditional application
servers (`tcp`), background applications (`queue`), and serverless functions.
You can use a collection of workloads of different types to deploy
microservices that function as a logical application, or deploy your
entire application as a single monolith.
