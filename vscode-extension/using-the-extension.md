## <a id="before-beginning"></a> Before Beginning

Ensure the project to use the extension with has the required files specified in the [Getting Started page](../vscode-extension/getting-started.md).

>**Note:** The Tanzu Developer Tools extension requires only one **Tiltfile** and one **workload.yaml** per project. The **workload.yaml** must be a single-document YAML file, not a multidocument YAML files.


## <a id="multiple-projects-in-workspace"></a> Multiple Projects in Workspace

When working with multiple projects in a single workspace, you can configure the Tanzu Dev Tools Extension settings on a per-project basis by using the dropdown selector in the `Settings` page.

## <a id="apply-workload"></a> Apply Workload

The extension enables you to apply workloads on your Tanzu Application Platform-enabled Kubernetes cluster.

To apply a workload from the command palette:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing ⇧⌘P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows.

1. Run `Tanzu: Apply Workload`.

    ![Command palette open showing text Tanzu: Apply Workload](../images/vscode-applyworkload1.png)

    If there are multiple projects with workloads, select the workload to apply.

    ![Apply Workload menu open showing workloads available to apply](../images/vscode-applyworkload2.png)

    A notification appears showing that the workload was applied.

    ![Apply Workload notification showing workload has been applied](../images/vscode-applyworkload3.png)

    A new workload appears on the Tanzu Workloads panel.

    ![Workload on Tanzu Workloads](../images/vscode-panel-workload-unknown.png)

    The workload panel shows the workloads running in the namespace that is defined in the current Kubernetes context.

1. (Optional) See the context and namespace currently configured by running

    ```console
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```

1. (Optional) Set a namespace for the current context by running

    ```console
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=YOUR-NAMESPACE
    ```

    After the workload is deployed, the status on the Tanzu Workloads panel changes to **Ready**.

    ![Workload ready on Tanzu Workloads](../images/vscode-panel-workload-ready.png)

To apply a workload from the context menu:

1. Apply a workload from the context menu by right-clicking on your workload file and selecting **Tanzu: Apply Workload**.

    ![Context menu open showing text Tanzu: Apply Workload](../images/vscode-applyworkload4.png)

    A notification appears showing that the workload was applied.

## <a id="debugging-on-the-cluster"></a> Debugging on the Cluster

The Tanzu Developer Tools extension enables you to debug your application on your TAP-enabled Kubernetes cluster.

Debugging requires a **workload.yaml** file in your project. For information about creating a **workload.yaml** file, see the [Set Up section](../vscode-extension/getting-started.md#set-up-tanzu-dev-tools).

>**Note:** Debugging on the cluster and Live Update can not be used simultaneously. If you have used Live Update for the current project, you must ensure you have stopped live update before attempting to debug on the cluster. See [Stop Live Update](#stop-live-update) for more information.


### <a id="start-debugging-on-the-cluster"></a> Start Debugging on the Cluster

To start debugging on the cluster:

1. Add a [breakpoint](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_breakpoints) in your code.
1. Right-click the **workload.yaml** file in your project.
1. Select `Tanzu: Java Debug Start` in the right-click menu.

![The VS Code interface showing the Explorer tab with the workload.yaml file right-click menu open and the "Tanzu: Java Debug Start" option highlighted](../images/vscode-startdebug1.png)


### <a id="stop-debugging-on-the-cluster"></a> Stop Debugging on the Cluster

To stop debugging on the cluster:

- Select the stop button in the Debug overlay.

    ![The VS Code interface close-up on the debug overlay showing the stop rectangle icon and mouseover description](../images/vscode-stopdebug1.png)

- Or select the trash can icon for the debug task running in the Panel (`View -> Appearance -> Show Panel`, or hotkey `⌘+J`).

    ![The VS Code interface close-up on the tasks panel showing the delete trash can icon](../images/vscode-stopdebug2.png)


## <a id="live-update"></a> Live Update

By using Live Update facilitated by [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/), the Tanzu Developer Tools extension enables you to deploy your workload once, save changes to the code and see those changes reflected in the workload running on the cluster within seconds.

Live update requires a **workload.yaml** file and a **Tiltfile** in your project. For information about how to create a **workload.yaml** and a **Tiltfile**, see the [Set Up section](../vscode-extension/getting-started.md#set-up-tanzu-dev-tools) on the Getting Started page.

>**Note:** Live Update and Debugging on the cluster can not be used simultaneously. If you are currently debugging on the cluster, you must stop the debugging process before attempting to use Live Update.

### <a id="start-live-update"></a> Start Live Update

There are two ways to start live update:

- Right-click your project’s `Tiltfile` and select `Tanzu: Live Update Start`.

    ![The VS Code interface showing the Explorer tab with the Tiltfile file right-click menu open and the "Tanzu: Live Update Start" option highlighted](../images/vscode-startliveupdate1.png)

- Start the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`) and run the `Tanzu: Live Update Start` command.

    ![Command palette open showing text Tanzu: Live Update Start](../images/vscode-startliveupdate2.png)


### <a id="stop-live-update"></a> Stop Live Update

When Live Update stops, your application continues to run on the cluster, but the changes you made and saved in your editor will not be present in your running application unless you redeploy your application to the cluster.

There are two ways to stop live update:

- Right-click your project’s `Tiltfile` and select `Tanzu: Live Update Stop`.

    ![The VS Code interface showing the Explorer tab with the Tiltfile file right-click menu open and the "Tanzu: Live Update Stop" option highlighted](../images/vscode-stopliveupdate1.png)

- Start the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`) and run the `Tanzu: Live Update Stop` command.

    ![Command palette open showing text Tanzu: Live Update Stop](../images/vscode-stopliveupdate2.png)


### <a id="disable-live-update"></a> Disable Live Update

You can remove the Live Update capability from your application entirely. This functionality can be useful in a troubleshooting scenario, or when you decide not to use Live Update.

>**Note:** Disabling Live Update redeploys your workload to the cluster and removes the Live Update capability.

To disable Live Update:

1. Start the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`).

1. Run the `Tanzu: Live Update Disable` command.

    ![Command palette open showing text Tanzu: Live Update Disable](../images/vscode-liveupdatedisable.png)

1. Enter the name of the workload you want to deactivate live update for.


### <a id="live-update-status"></a> Live Update Status

The current status of Live Update is visible on the right side of the Status Bar at the bottom of the VS Code window.

![The VS Code interface showing the Tanzu Live Update Status section of the Status bar](../images/vscode-liveupdatestatus1.png)

The Live Update status bar entry reflects the following states:

- Live Update Stopped
- Live Update Starting…
- Live Update Running

The Live Update status bar entry can be hidden by right-clicking on it and selecting `Hide ‘Tanzu Developer Tools (Extension)’`.

![The VS Code interface showing the Tanzu Live Update Status section of the Status bar with the right-click menu open and the "Hide 'Tanzu Developer Tools (Extension)'" option highlighted](../images/vscode-liveupdatestatus2.png)


## <a id="delete-workload"></a> Delete Workload

The extension enables you to delete workloads on your Tanzu Application Platform-enabled Kubernetes cluster.

To delete a workload:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing ⇧⌘P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows.

1. Run `Tanzu: Delete Workload`.

    ![Command palette open showing text Tanzu: Delete Workload](../images/vscode-deleteworkload1.png)

1. Select the workload to delete.

    ![Delete Workload menu open showing workloads available to delete](../images/vscode-deleteworkload2.png)

    If the **Tanzu: Confirm Delete** setting is enabled, a message appears that prompts you to delete the workload and not warn again, delete the workload, or cancel.

    ![Delete Confirmation Notification showing delete options](../images/vscode-deleteworkload3.png)

    A notification appears showing that the workload was deleted.

    ![Delete Workload Notification showing workload has been deleted](../images/vscode-deleteworkload4.png)


## <a id="switch-namespace"></a> Switch Namespace

To switch the namespace where you created the workload:

1. Go to **Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings**.
1. Expand the **Extensions** section of the settings and select **Tanzu**.
1. In the Namespace option, add the namespace you want to deploy to. This is the `default` namespace by default.

![The VS Code settings scrolled to the Tanzu section within the Extensions section](../images/vscode-switchnamespace1.png)


## <a id="workload-panel"></a> Tanzu Workloads Panel

The current state of the workloads is visible on the Tanzu Workloads panel in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window. The panel shows the current status of each workload, namespace, cluster and whether Live Update and Debug are running, stopped or disabled.

The Tanzu Workloads panel uses the cluster and namespace specified in the current kubectl context. You can run: `kubectl config get-contexts` to view the current context and namespace. To set a namespace for the current context run: `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=YOURNAMESPACE`.
