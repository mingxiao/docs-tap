**Deploy applications directly from VS Code**

The Tanzu Dev Tools extension enables rapid iteration of your applications on Tanzu Application Platform by deploying them as workloads directly from within VS Code.

**See code updates running on-cluster in seconds**

With Live Update (facilitated by Tilt), the Tanzu Developer Tools extension enables you to deploy your workload once, save changes to the code and see those changes reflected within seconds in the workload running on the cluster.

**Debug workloads directly on the cluster**

The Tanzu Developer Tools extension enables you to debug your application in a production-like environment* by debugging on your Kubernetes cluster enabled by Tanzu Application Platform.

**See workloads running on the cluster**

With a workload panel you can see any workload found within the cluster and namespace specified in the current kubectl context.

*An environmentâ€™s similarity to production relies on keeping dependencies updated, among other variables.
