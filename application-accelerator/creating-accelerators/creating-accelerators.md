# Creating accelerators

This topic describes how to create an accelerator in Tanzu Application Platform GUI. An accelerator contains your enterprise-conformant code and configurations that developers can use to create new projects that by default follow the standards defined in your accelerators.

## <a id="creating-accelerators-prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to create an accelerator:

  - Application Accelerator is installed. For information about installing Application Accelerator, see [Installing Application Accelerator for VMware Tanzu](../installation/install.md)
  - You can access Tanzu Application Platform GUI from a browser. For more information, see the "Tanzu Application Platform GUI" section in the most recent release for [Tanzu Application Platform documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/index.html)
  - kubectl v1.20 and later. The Kubernetes command line tool (kubectl) is installed and authenticated with admin rights for your target cluster.

## <a id="creating-accelerators-getting-started"></a>Getting started

You can use any Git repository to create an accelerator. You need the URL for the repository to create an accelerator.

For this example, the Git repository is `public` and contains a `README.md` file. These are options available when you create repositories on GitHub.

Use the following procedure to create an accelerator based on this Git repository:

1. Clone your Git repository.

2. Create a file named `accelerator.yaml` in the root directory of this Git repository.

3. Add the following content to the `accelerator.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    accelerator:
      displayName: Simple Accelerator
      description: Contains just a README
      iconUrl: https://images.freecreatives.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/smiley-559124_640.jpg
      tags:
      - simple
      - getting-started
    ```

    Feel free to use a different icon if it uses a reachable URL.

4. Add the new `accelerator.yaml` file, commit this change, and push to your Git repository.

2. To publish your new accelerator, run this command in your terminal:
    
    ```sh
    tanzu accelerator create simple --git-repository YOUR-GIT-REPOSITORY-URL --git-branch YOUR-GIT-BRANCH
    ```

    Where:
    
    - `YOUR-GIT-REPOSITORY-URL` is the URL for your Git repository.
    - `YOUR-GIT-BRANCH` is the name of the branch where you pushed the new `accelerator.yaml` file.

3. Refresh Tanzu Application Platform GUI to reveal the newly published accelerator.

    >**Note:** It might take a few seconds for Tanzu Application Platform GUI to refresh the catalog and add an entry for your new accelerator.

An alternative to using the Tanzu CLI is to create a separate manifest file and apply it to the cluster:

1. Create a `simple-manifest.yaml` file and add the following content, filling in with your Git repository and branch values.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: accelerator.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Accelerator
    metadata:
      name: simple
      namespace: accelerator-system
    spec:
      git:
        url: YOUR-GIT-REPOSITORY-URL
        ref:
          branch: YOUR-GIT-BRANCH
    ```

1. To apply the `simple-manifest.yaml`, run this command in your terminal in the directory where you created this file:

    ```sh
    tanzu accelerator apply -f simple-manifest.yaml
    ```

## <a id="using-accelerator-fragments"></a>Using accelerator fragments

Accelerator fragments are reusable accelerator components that can provide options, files or transforms. They can be imported into accelerators using an `import` entry and the transforms from the fragment can be referenced in an `InvokeFragment` transform in the accelerator that is declaring the import. For additional detail see [InvokeFragment transform](transforms/invoke-fragment.md).

The accelerator samples include three fragments - `java-version`, `tap-initialize`, and `live-update`. See the [sample-accelerators/fragments](https://github.com/sample-accelerators/fragments/tree/tap-1.2) Git repository for the content of these fragments.

To discover what fragments are available to use, you can run the following command:

```
tanzu accelerator fragment list
```

We will look a the `java-version` fragment as an example. It contains the following `accelerator.yaml` file:

```
accelerator:
  options:
  - name: javaVersion
    inputType: select
    label: Java version to use
    choices:
    - value: "1.8"
      text: Java 8
    - value: "11"
      text: Java 11
    - value: "17"
      text: Java 17
    defaultValue: "11"
    required: true

engine:
  merge:
    - include: [ "pom.xml" ]
      chain:
      - type: ReplaceText
        regex:
          pattern: "<java.version>.*<"
          with: "'<java.version>' + #javaVersion + '<'"
    - include: [ "build.gradle" ]
      chain:
      - type: ReplaceText
        regex:
          pattern: "sourceCompatibility = .*"
          with: "'sourceCompatibility = ''' + #javaVersion + ''''"
    - include: [ "config/workload.yaml" ]
      chain:
      - type: ReplaceText
        condition: "#javaVersion == '17'"
        substitutions:
          - text: "spec:"
            with: "'spec:\n  build:\n    env:\n    - name: BP_JVM_VERSION\n      value: \"17\"'"
```

This fragment will contribute the following to any accelerator that imports it:

1. An option named `javaVersion` with three choices `Java 8`, `Java 11`, and `Java 17`
1. Three `ReplaceText` transforms:
    - if the accelerator has a `pom.xml` file then what is specified for `<java.version>` will be replaced with the chosen version.
    - if the accelerator has a `build.gradle` file then what is specified for `sourceCompatibility` will be replaced with the chosen version.
    - if the accelerator has a `config/workload.yaml` file and the user selected "Java 17" then a build env entry of BP_JVM_VERSION will be inserted into the `spec:` section.

To deploy new fragments to the accelerator system you can use the new `tanzu accelerator fragment create` CLI command or you can apply a custom resource manifest file with either `kubectl apply` or the `tanzu accelerator apply` commands.

The resource manifest for the `java-version` fragment looks like this:

```
apiVersion: accelerator.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Fragment
metadata:
  name: java-version
  namespace: accelerator-system
spec:
  displayName: Select Java Version
  git:
    ref:
      branch: tap-1.2
    url: https://github.com/sample-accelerators/fragments.git
    subPath: java-version
```

To create the fragment (we can save the above manifest in a `java-version.yaml` file) and use:

```
tanzu accelerator apply -f ./java-version.yaml
```

>**Note:** The `accelerator apply` command can be used to apply both Accelerator and Fragment resources.

To avoid having to create a separate manifest file, you can use the following command instead:

```
tanzu accelerator fragment create java-version \
  --git-repo https://github.com/sample-accelerators/fragments.git \
  --git-branch main \
  --git-tag tap-1.2 \
  --git-sub-path java-version
```

Now you can use this `java-version` fragment in an accelerator:

```
accelerator:
  displayName: Hello Fragment
  description: A sample app
  tags:
  - java
  - spring
  - cloud
  - tanzu

  imports:
  - name: java-version

engine:
  merge:
    - include: ["**/*"]
    - type: InvokeFragment
      reference: java-version
```

The above acelerator imports the `java-version` which, as we saw above, provides an option to select the Java version to use for the project. It then instructs the engine to invoke the transforms provided in the fragment that will update the Java version used in `pom.xml` and/or `build.gradle` files from the accelerator.

For more detail on the use of fragments, see [InvokeFragment transform](transforms/invoke-fragment.md).
