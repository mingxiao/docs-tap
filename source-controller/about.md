# Source Controller

Tanzu Source Controller provides a standard interface for artifact acquisition. It supports two resource types,

- ImageRepository
- MavenArtifact

An `ImageRepository` resource can resolve the source from the contents of an image in an image registry. This functionality enables app developers to create and update workloads from local source code or a code repository.

A `MavenArtifact` resource can resolve a binary artifact from a Maven repository. This functionality enables the supply chain to support artifacts produced externally.

Tanzu Source Controller extends the functionality of the FluxCD Source Controller Kubernetes operator. For more information about FluxCD Source Controller, see the
[fluxcd/source-controller](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller) project on GitHub.
