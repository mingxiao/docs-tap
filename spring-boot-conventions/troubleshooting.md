# Troubleshoot Spring Boot Conventions

## <a id="collect-logs"></a>Collect logs

If you have trouble, you can retrieve and examine logs from the Spring Boot convention server as follows:

1. The Spring Boot convention server creates a namespace to contain all of the associated resources. By default the namespace is `spring-boot-convention`. To inspect the logs, run the following command:

    ```console
    $ kubectl logs -l app=spring-boot-webhook -n spring-boot-convention

    {"level":"info","timestamp":"2021-11-11T16:00:26.597Z","caller":"spring-boot-conventions/server.go:83","msg":"Successfully applied convention: spring-boot","component":"spring-boot-conventions"}
    {"level":"info","timestamp":"2021-11-11T16:00:26.597Z","caller":"spring-boot-conventions/server.go:83","msg":"Successfully applied convention: spring-boot-graceful-shutdown","component":"spring-boot-conventions"}
    {"level":"info","timestamp":"2021-11-11T16:00:26.597Z","caller":"spring-boot-conventions/server.go:83","msg":"Successfully applied convention: spring-boot-web","component":"spring-boot-conventions"}
    {"level":"info","timestamp":"2021-11-11T16:00:26.597Z","caller":"spring-boot-conventions/server.go:83","msg":"Successfully applied convention: spring-boot-actuator","component":"spring-boot-conventions"}
    {"level":"info","timestamp":"2021-11-11T16:00:26.597Z","caller":"spring-boot-conventions/server.go:83","msg":"Successfully applied convention: service-intent-mysql","component":"spring-boot-conventions"}
    ```

2. For all of the conventions that were applied successfully, a log entry is added. In case of an error, a log entry is added with a description.
