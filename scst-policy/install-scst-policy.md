# Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller 

Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller is installed as part of Tanzu Application 
Platform's Full, Iterate and Run profiles. Use the instructions in this topic to manually install this component.

## <a id='scst-policy-prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

- Complete all prerequisites to install Tanzu Application Platform. For more information, see [Prerequisites](../prerequisites.md).
- A container image registry that supports TLS connections. 
>**Note:** This component does not work with not secure registries.

- During configuration for this component, you are asked to provide a cosign public key to use to
validate signed images. An example cosign public key is provided that can validate an image from the
public cosign registry. To provide your own key and images, follow the
[cosign quick start guide](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#quick-start) to generate your own keys and sign an image.

>**Caution:** This component WILL REJECT `Pods` if it is not correctly configured. Test your configuration in a test environment before applying policies to your production cluster.

                                                  Controller manager. During CPU contention, CPU request is used as
                                                  a weighting where higher CPU requests are allocated more CPU time.

    deployment_namespace  cosign-system  string   Deployment namespace specifies the namespace where this component should be
                                                  deployed to. If not specified, "cosign-system" is assumed.

                                                  priority class system-cluster-critical. This value must be enclosed in quotes
                                                  (""). If this value is not specified then a default value of 6 is used.
    replicas              1              integer  The number of replicas to be created for the Policy Controller. This value must
                                                  not be enclosed in quotes. If this value is not specified then a default value
                                                  of 1 is used.

    ```

1. Create a file named `scst-policy-values.yaml` and add the settings you want to customize:

    - `custom_ca_secrets`:
      If your container registries are secured by self-signed certificates, this setting controls which secrets are added to the application
      container as custom certificate authorities (CAs). `custom_ca_secrets`
      consists of an array of items. Each item contains two fields:
      the `secret_name` field defines the name of the secret,
      and the `namespace` field defines the name of the namespace where said
      secret is stored.

      For example:

      ```yaml
      custom_ca_secrets:
      - secret_name: first-ca
          namespace: ca-namespace
      - secret_name: second-ca
          namespace: ca-namespace
      ```

      >**Note:** This setting is allowed even if `custom_cas` is defined.

    - `custom_cas`:
      This setting enables adding certificate content in PEM format.
      The certificate content is added to the application container as custom
      certificate authorities (CAs) to communicate with registries deployed with
      self-signed certificates.
      `custom_cas` consists of an array of items. Each item contains
      a single field named `ca_content`. The value of this field must be a
      PEM-formatted certificate authority. The certificate content must be
      defined as a YAML block, preceded by the literal indicator (`|`) to
      preserve line breaks and ensure the certificates are interpreted correctly.

      For example:

      ```yaml
      custom_cas:
      - ca_content: |
            ----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE -----
            first certificate content here...
            ----- END CERTIFICATE -----
      - ca_content: |
            ----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE -----
            second certificate content here...
            ----- END CERTIFICATE -----
      ```

      >**Note:** This setting is allowed even if `custom_ca_secrets` is defined.

    - `deployment_namespace`:
      This setting controls the namespace to which this component is deployed.
      When not specified, the namespace `cosign-system` is assumed.
      This component creates the specified namespace to deploy required
      resources. Select a namespace that is not used by any
      other components.

    - `limits_cpu`:
      This setting controls the maximum CPU resource allocated to the Policy
      admission controller. The default value is "200m". See [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu) for more details.

    - `limits_memory`:
      This setting controls the maximum memory resource allocated to the Policy
      admission controller. The default value is "256Mi". See [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory) for more details.

    - `quota.pod_number`:
      This setting controls the maximum number of Pods that are allowed in the
      deployment namespace with the `system-cluster-critical`
      priority class. This priority class is added to the Pods to prevent
      preemption of this component's Pods in case of node pressure.

      The default value for this field is `5`. If your use case requires
      more than 5 Pods, change this value to allow the number of replicas you intend to deploy.
      
      >**Note:** VMware recommends to run this component with a critical priority level to prevent the cluster from rejecting all admission requests if the component's `Pod`s are evicted due to resource limitations.

    - `replicas`:
      This setting controls the default amount of replicas deployed by  this
      component. The default value is `1`.

      **For production environments**: VMware recommends you increase the number of replicas to
        `3` to ensure availability of the component and better admission performance.

    - `requests_cpu`:
      This setting controls the minimum CPU resource allocated to the Policy
      admission controller. During CPU contention, this value is used as a weighting
      where higher values indicate more CPU time is allocated. The default value is `100m`.
      See [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu) for more details.

    - `requests_memory`:
      This setting controls the minimum memory resource allocated to the Policy
      admission controller. The default value is "50Mi". See [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory) for more details.

1. Install the package:

    ```console
    tanzu package install policy-controller \
      --package-name policy.apps.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version VERSION \
      --namespace tap-install \
      --values-file scst-policy-values.yaml
    ```

    Where `VERSION` is the version number you discovered earlier. For example, `1.0.0`.

    For example:

    ```console
    $ tanzu package install policy-controller \
        --package-name policy.apps.tanzu.vmware.com \
        --version 1.0.0 \
        --namespace tap-install \
        --values-file scst-policy-values.yaml

      Installing package 'policy.apps.tanzu.vmware.com'
      Getting package metadata for 'policy.apps.tanzu.vmware.com'
      Creating service account 'policy-controller-tap-install-sa'
      Creating cluster admin role 'policy-controller-tap-install-cluster-role'
      Creating cluster role binding 'policy-controller-tap-install-cluster-rolebinding'
      Creating package resource
      Waiting for 'PackageInstall' reconciliation for 'policy-controller'
      'PackageInstall' resource install status: Reconciling
      'PackageInstall' resource install status: ReconcileSucceeded
      'PackageInstall' resource successfully reconciled

      Added installed package 'policy-controller'
    ```

After you run the commands earlier the policy controller is running.

>**Note:** Policy Controller is now installed, but it does not enforce any
policies by default. Policies must be explicitly configured on the cluster.
To configure signature verification policies, see [Configuring Supply Chain
Security Tools - Policy](configuring.md).
