# Consume services on Tanzu Application Platform

This how-to guide walks you through deploying two application workloads and learning how to configure them to communicate over RabbitMQ. You will learn about the `tanzu services` CLI plug-in and the most important APIs for working with services on Tanzu Application Platform.

>**Note:** The first three parts of this walkthrough applies to operators and the final part to developers.

## <a id="you-will"></a>What you will do

- Set up a service.
- Create a service instance.
- Claim a service instance.
- Bind an application workload to the service instance.

Before you begin, for important background, see [About consuming services on Tanzu Application Platform](about-consuming-services.md).

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The following diagram depicts a summary of what this walkthrough covers.

![Diagram shows the default namespace and service instances namespace. The default namespace has two application workloads, each connected to a service binding. The service bindings connect to the service instance in the service instances namespace through a resource claim.](../images/getting-started-stk-1.png)

Bear the following observations in mind as you work through this guide.

1. There is a clear separation of concerns across the various user roles:
    * The life cycle of workloads is determined by application developers.
    * The life cycle of resource claims is determined by application operators.
    * The life cycle of service instances is determined by service operators.
    * The life cycle of service bindings is implicitly tied to lifecycle of workloads.
1. Resource claims and resource claim policies are the mechanism to enable cross-namespace binding.
1. [ProvisionedService](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec#provisioned-service) is the contract allowing credentials and connectivity information to flow from the service instance, to the resource claim, to the service binding, and ultimately to the application workload.
1. Exclusivity of resource claims:
    * Resource claims are considered to be mutually exclusive, meaning that service instances can be claimed by at most one resource claim.

## <a id="stk-prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

Before following this walkthrough, you must:

1. Have access to a cluster with Tanzu Application Platform installed.
1. Have downloaded and installed the `tanzu` CLI and the corresponding plug-ins.
1. Have setup the `default` namespace to use installed packages and use it as your developer namespace.
For more information, see [Set up developer namespaces to use installed packages](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.1/tap/GUID-install-components.html#setup)).
1. Ensure your Tanzu Application Platform cluster can pull source code from GitHub.
1. Ensure your Tanzu Application Platform cluster can pull the images required by the [RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/using-operator.html).

## <a id="stk-set-up"></a> Set up a service

This section covers the following:

* Installing the [RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/using-operator.html)
* Creating the RBAC rules to grant Tanzu Application Platform permission to interact
with the newly-installed APIs provided by the RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator.
* Creating the additional supporting resources to aid with discovery of services.

For this part of the walkthrough, you assume the role of the **service operator**.

> **Note:** Although this walkthrough uses the RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes operator
> as an example, the set up steps remain mostly the same for any compatible operator.

To set up a service:

1. Use `kapp` to install the RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator by running:

    ```console
    kapp -y deploy --app rmq-operator --file https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/releases/download/v1.9.0/cluster-operator.yml
    ```

    As a result, a new API Group (`rabbitmq.com`) and Kind (`RabbitmqCluster`) are
    now available in the cluster.

1. Apply RBAC rules to grant Tanzu Application Platform permission to interact with the new API.

    1. In a file named `resource-claims-rmq.yaml`, create a `ClusterRole` that defines the rules and label it so that the rules are aggregated to the appropriate controller:

        ```yaml
        # resource-claims-rmq.yaml
        ---
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRole
        metadata:
          name: resource-claims-rmq
          labels:
            servicebinding.io/controller: "true"
        rules:
        - apiGroups: ["rabbitmq.com"]
          resources: ["rabbitmqclusters"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
        ```

    1. Apply `resource-claims-rmq.yaml` by running:

        ```console
        kubectl apply -f resource-claims-rmq.yaml
        ```

    1. In a file named `rabbitmqcluster-app-operator-reader.yaml`, define RBAC
    rules that permit the users of the cluster to interact with the new APIs.
    For example, to permit application operators to get, list, and watch for `RabbitmqCluster` service instances,
    apply the following RBAC `ClusterRole`, labeled so that the rules are aggregated to the `app-operator` role:

        ```yaml
        # rabbitmqcluster-app-operator-reader.yaml
        ---
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRole
        metadata:
          name: rabbitmqcluster-app-operator-reader
          labels:
            apps.tanzu.vmware.com/aggregate-to-app-operator-cluster-access: "true"
        rules:
        - apiGroups: ["rabbitmq.com"]
          resources: ["rabbitmqclusters"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
        ```

    1. Apply `rabbitmqcluster-app-operator-reader.yaml` by running:

        ```console
        kubectl apply -f rabbitmqcluster-app-operator-reader.yaml
        ```

1. Make the new API seen as claimable to application operators.

    1. In a file named `rabbitmqcluster-clusterinstanceclass.yaml`, create a `ClusterInstanceClass`
    that refers to the new service, and set any additional metadata. For example:

        ```yaml
        # rabbitmqcluster-clusterinstanceclass.yaml
        ---
        apiVersion: services.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
        kind: ClusterInstanceClass
        metadata:
          name: rabbitmq
        spec:
          description:
            short: It's a RabbitMQ cluster!
          pool:
            group: rabbitmq.com
            kind: RabbitmqCluster
        ```

    1. Apply `rabbitmqcluster-clusterinstanceclass.yaml` by running:

        ```console
        kubectl apply -f rabbitmqcluster-clusterinstanceclass.yaml
        ```

        After applying this resource, it will be listed in the output of the
        `tanzu service classes list` command, and is discoverable in the `tanzu` tooling.

## <a id="stk-create-svc-instances"></a> Create a service instance

This section covers the following:

* Using kubectl to create a `RabbitmqCluster` service instance.
* Creating a resource claim policy that permits the service instance to be claimed.

For this part of the walkthrough, you assume the role of the **service operator**.

To create a service instance:

1. Create a dedicated namespace for service instances by running:

    ```console
    kubectl create namespace service-instances
    ```

    > **Note:** Using namespaces to separate service instances from application workloads allows
    > for greater separation of concerns, and means that you can achieve greater control
    > over who has access to what. However, this is not a strict requirement.
    > You can create both service instances and application workloads in the same namespace if desired.

2.  Find the list of service instance classes available on your cluster by running:

    ```console
    tanzu service classes list
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```console
    tanzu service classes list

     NAME      DESCRIPTION
     rabbitmq  It's a RabbitMQ cluster!
    ```

    > **Note**: If you see `No service types found.`, ensure you have completed the
    > steps in [Set up a service](#stk-set-up) earlier in this walkthrough.

1. Create a `RabbitmqCluster` service instance.

    1. Create a file named `rmq-1-service-instance.yaml` using the `APIVERSION` and
    `KIND` from the output of the `tanzu service types list` command:

        ```yaml
        # rmq-1-service-instance.yaml
        ---
        apiVersion: rabbitmq.com/v1beta1
        kind: RabbitmqCluster
        metadata:
          name: rmq-1
          namespace: service-instances
        ```

    1. Apply `rmq-1-service-instance.yaml` by running:

        ```console
        kubectl apply -f rmq-1-service-instance.yaml
        ```

3. Create a resource claim policy to define the namespaces the instance can be claimed and bound from:

    > **Note:** By default, you can only claim and bind to service instances that
    > are running in the _same_ namespace as the application workloads.
    > To claim service instances that are running in a different namespace, you must
    > create a resource claim policy.

    1. Create a file named `rmq-claim-policy.yaml` as follows:

        ```yaml
        # rmq-claim-policy.yaml
        ---
        apiVersion: services.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
        kind: ResourceClaimPolicy
        metadata:
          name: rabbitmqcluster-cross-namespace
          namespace: service-instances
        spec:
          consumingNamespaces:
          - '*'
          subject:
            group: rabbitmq.com
            kind: RabbitmqCluster
        ```

    1. Apply `rmq-claim-policy.yaml` by running:

        ```console
        kubectl apply -f rmq-claim-policy.yaml
        ```

    This policy states that any resource of kind `RabbitmqCluster` on the `rabbitmq.com`
    API group in the `service-instances` namespace can be consumed from any namespace.

## <a id="stk-claim"></a> Claim a service instance

This section covers the following:

* Using `tanzu service claimable list --class` to view details about service instances claimable from a namespace.
* Using `tanzu service claim create` to create a claim for the service instance.

For this part of the walkthrough, you assume the role of the **application operator**.

Resource claims in Tanzu Application Platform are a powerful concept that serve many purposes.
Arguably their most important role is to enable application operators to request
services that they can use with their application workloads without them having
to create and manage the services themselves.
Resource claims provide a mechanism for application operators to say what
they want, without having to worry about anything that goes into providing what they want.
For more information, see [Resource Claims](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Services-Toolkit-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/0.6/svc-tlk/GUID-service_resource_claims-terminology_and_apis.html).

In cases where service instances are running in the same namespace as
application workloads, you do not have to create a claim. You can bind to the service instance directly.

In this section you will use the `tanzu service claims create` command to create
claim that the `RabbitmqCluster` service instance you created earlier can fulfill.
This command requires the following information to create a claim successfully:

- `--resource-name`
- `--resource-kind`
- `--resource-api-version`
- `--resource-namespace`

To claim a service instance:

1. Find the claimable instance and the necessary claim information by running:

    ```console
    tanzu service claimable list --class rabbitmq
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```console
      tanzu services claimable list --class rabbitmq

      NAME    NAMESPACE            API KIND         API GROUP/VERSION
      rmq-1   service-instances    RabbitmqCluster  rabbitmq.com/v1beta1
    ```

1. Using the information from the previous command, create a claim for the service instance by running:

    ```console
    tanzu service claim create rmq-1 \
      --resource-name rmq-1 \
      --resource-namespace service-instances \
      --resource-kind RabbitmqCluster \
      --resource-api-version rabbitmq.com/v1beta1
    ```

In the next section you will see how to inspect the claim and to then use it to bind to application workloads.

## <a id="stk-bind"></a> Bind an application workload to the service instance

This section covers the following:

* Using `tanzu service claim list` and `tanzu service claim get` to find information about the claim to use for binding.
* Using `tanzu apps workload create` with the `--service-ref` flag to create a workload and bind it to the service instance.

For this part of the walkthrough, you assume the role of the **application developer**.

As a final step, you must create application workloads and bind them to the service instance using the claim.

In Tanzu Application Platform, service bindings are created when application workloads
that specify `.spec.serviceClaims` are created.
In this section, you create such workloads using the `--service-ref`
flag of the `tanzu apps workload create` command.

To create an application workload:

1. Inspect the claims in the developer namespace to find the value to pass to
`--service-ref` command by running:

    ```console
    tanzu services claims list
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```console
      Warning: This is an ALPHA command and may change without notice.

      NAME   READY  REASON
      rmq-1  True
    ```

1. Retrieve detailed information about the claim by running:

    ```console
    tanzu services claims get rmq-1
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```console
      Warning: This is an ALPHA command and may change without notice.

    Name: rmq-1
    Status:
      Ready: True
    Namespace: default
    Claim Reference: services.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1:ResourceClaim:rmq-1
    Resource to Claim:
      Name: rmq-1
      Namespace: service-instances
      Group: rabbitmq.com
      Version: v1beta1
      Kind: RabbitmqCluster
    ```

1. Record the value of `Claim Reference` from the previous command.
This is the value to pass to `--service-ref` to create the application workload.

1. Create the application workload by running:

    ```console
    tanzu apps workload create spring-sensors-consumer-web \
      --git-repo https://github.com/sample-accelerators/spring-sensors-rabbit \
      --git-branch main \
      --type web \
      --service-ref="rmq=services.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1:ResourceClaim:rmq-1"

    tanzu apps workload create \
      spring-sensors-producer \
      --git-repo https://github.com/tanzu-end-to-end/spring-sensors-sensor \
      --git-branch main \
      --type web \
      --service-ref="rmq=services.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1:ResourceClaim:rmq-1" \
      --annotation=autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale="1"
    ```

    Using the `--service-ref` flag instructs Tanzu Application Platform to bind the application workload to the service provided in the `ref`.

    > **Note:** You are not passing a service ref to the `RabbitmqCluster` service instance directly,
    > but rather to the resource claim that has claimed the `RabbitmqCluster` service instance.
    > See the [consuming services diagram](#overview) at the beginning of this walkthrough.

1. After the workloads are ready, visit the URL of the `spring-sensors-consumer-web` app.
Confirm that sensor data, passing from the `spring-sensors-producer` workload to
the `create spring-sensors-consumer-web` workload using our `RabbitmqCluster` service instance, is displayed.
