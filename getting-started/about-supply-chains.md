# Supply chains on Tanzu Application Platform

Supply Chains provide a way of codifying all of the steps of your path to production, more commonly known as continuous integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver applications by introducing automation into the stages of application development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is the method used by supply chain to deliver applications through automation where supply chain allows you to use CI/CD and add any other steps necessary for an application to reach production, or a different environment such as staging.

## <a id="path-to-prod"></a>A path to production

A path to production allows users to create a unified access point for all of the tools required
for their applications to reach a customer-facing environment.
Instead of having four tools that are loosely coupled to each other, a path to production defines
all four tools in a single, unified layer of abstraction, which may be automated and repeatable between teams for applications at scale.

Where tools typically are not able to integrate with one another and additional scripting or
webhooks are necessary, there would be a unified automation tool to codify all the interactions
between each of the tools.
Supply chains used to codify the organization's path to production are configurable, allowing their
authors to add all of the steps of their application's path to production.

## <a id="avail-supply-chains"></a>Available Supply Chains

The Tanzu Application Platform provides three out of the box (OOTB) supply chains to
work with the Tanzu Application Platform components. They include:

-  OOTB Supply Chain Basic (default)
-  OOTB Supply Chain with Testing (optional)
-  OOTB Supply Chain with Testing+Scanning (optional)

## <a id="OOTB-basic-sc-default"></a>1: **OOTB Basic (default)**

The default **OOTB Basic** supply chain and its dependencies were installed on your cluster during the Tanzu Application Platform install.
The following table and diagrams provide descriptions for each of the supply chains and dependencies provided with the Tanzu Application Platform.

   <td>This supply chain monitors a repository that is identified in the developerâ€™s `workload.yaml` file. When any new commits are made to the application, the supply chain:
<ul>

<li>Creates a new image.

<li>Applies any predefined conventions.

## <a id="OOTB-testing"></a>2: **OOTB Testing**

The **OOTB Testing** supply chain runs a Tekton pipeline within the supply chain.

## <a id="OOTB-test-and-scan"></a>3: **OOTB Testing+Scanning**

The **OOTB Testing+Scanning** supply chain includes integrations for secure scanning tools.
