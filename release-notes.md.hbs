  - Run Snyk Scanner on `ImageScan`s for the Scan-Link controller.

#### Supply Chain Choreographer

- View resource status on a workload
  - Added ability to indicate how Cartographer can read the state of the resource and reflect it on the owner status.
  - Surfaces information about the health of resources directly on the owner status.
  - Adds a field in the spec `healthRule` where authors can specify how to determine the health of the underlying resource for that template. The resource can be in one of the following states: A stamped resource can be in one of three states: 'Healthy' (status True), 'Unhealthy' (status False), or 'Unknown'  (status Unknown). If no healthRule is defined, Cartographer defaults to listing the resource as `Healthy` once it is successfully applied to the cluster and any outputs are read off the resource.
- [Cartographer Conventions](./cartographer-conventions/about.md) v0.1.0 is now bundled with the Supply Chain Choreographer
  - As of v0.07.0 release of [Convention Controller](./convention-service/about.md), it's APIs are deprecated in favor of continuing development on [Cartographer Conventions](./cartographer-conventions/about.md). Cartographer Conventions is now bundled with Supply Chain Choreographer.

#### <a id="scst-scan"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- Scan-Link's controller abstraction from the scanners' output format allows more flexibility when you integrate new scanners.

  - The deny rule has changed from the boolean `isCompliant` to the array of strings `deny[msg]`.

### <a id='1-2-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### Tanzu Application Platform

- **AWS EKS clusters:** When connecting to AWS EKS clusters an error might appear with the text `Error: Unable to connect: connection refused. Confirm kubeconfig details and try again` or `invalid apiVersion "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"`. The cause is [Kubernetes v1.24](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/kubernetes-1-24-release-announcement/) dropping support for `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1`. For more information, see [aws/aws-cli/issues/6920](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/6920) in GitHub. To fix, update `aws-cli` to the latest version, and then run:

    ```console
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME} --region ${REGION}
    ```
