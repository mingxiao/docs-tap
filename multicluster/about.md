# Overview of multicluster Tanzu Application Platform

You can install Tanzu Application Platform in various topologies to reflect your existing landscape. VMware has tested and recommends a multicluster topology for production use. Because flexibility and choice are core to Tanzu Application Platform's design, none of the implementation recommendations are set in stone. 

The multicluster topology uses the [profile capabilities](../overview.md#profiles-and-packages) supported by Tanzu Application Platform. Each cluster adopts one of three multicluster-aligned profiles:

- **Iterate:** Intended for inner-loop iterative application development.

- **Build:** Transforms source revisions to workload revisions; specifically, hosting workloads and supply chains.
 
- **Run:** Transforms workload revisions to running pods; specifically, hosting deliveries and deliverables.

- **View:** For applications related to centralized developer experiences; specifically, Tanzu Application Platform GUI and metadata store.

The following diagram illustrates this topology.
