# Observing and troubleshooting

This section shows how to observe the scan job and get logs.

## <a id="watch-inflight-jobs"></a>Watching in-flight jobs
The scan will run inside the job, which creates a Pod. Both the job and Pod will be cleaned up automatically after completion. You can set a watch on the job and Pod before applying a new scan to observe the job deployment.

```console
watch kubectl get scantemplates,scanpolicies,sourcescans,imagescans,pods,jobs
```

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting
If you run into any problems or face non-expected behavior, you can always address the logs to get more feedback.

```console
kubectl -n scan-link-system logs -f deployment/scan-link-controller-manager -c manager
```

### <a id="miss-img-ps"></a>Missing target image pull secret

Scanning an image from a private registry requires an image pull secret to exist in the Scan CR's namespace and be referenced as `grype.targetImagePullSecret` in `tap-values.yaml`. See [Installing the Tanzu Application Platform Package and Profiles](../install.md) for more information.

If a private image scan is triggered and the secret is not configured, the scan job will fail with the error as follows:

```console
Job.batch "scan-${app}-${id}" is invalid: [spec.template.spec.volumes[2].secret.secretName: Required value, spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[2].name: Not found: "registry-cred"]
```


### <a id="disable-scst-store"></a> Disable Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store is a prerequisite for installing Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan.
If you choose to install without the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store,  you need to edit the
configurations to disable the Store:

  ```yaml
  ---
  metadataStore:
    url: ""
  ```

  Install the package with the edited configurations by running:

  ```console
  tanzu package install scan-controller \
    --package-name scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com \
    --version VERSION \
    --namespace tap-install \
    --values-file tap-values.yaml
  ```

### <a id="incompatible-syft-schema-version"></a> Resolving Incompatible Syft Schema Version

  You might encounter the following error:

  ```console
  The provided SBOM has a Syft Schema Version which doesn't match the version that is supported by Grype...
  ```

  This means that the Syft Schema Version from the provided SBOM doesn't match the version supported by the installed grype-scanner. There are two different methods to resolve this incompatibility issue:

  - (Preferred method) Install a version of [Tanzu Build Service](../tanzu-build-service/tbs-about.md) that provides an SBOM with a compatible Syft Schema Version.
  - Deactivate the `failOnSchemaErrors` in `grype-values.yaml` (see [installation steps](install-scst-scan.md)). Although this change bypasses the check on Syft Schema Version, it does not resolve the incompatibility issue and produces a partial scanning result.

    ```yaml
    syft:
      failOnSchemaErrors: false
    ```
