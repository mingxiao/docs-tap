# Out of the Box Supply Chain with Testing and Scanning

This package contains Cartographer Supply Chains that tie together a series of
Kubernetes resources that drive a developer-provided workload from source code
to a Kubernetes configuration ready to be deployed to a cluster.
It contains supply chains that not only pass the source code through testing and vulnerability
scanning, but also the container image produced.

This package includes all the capabilities of the Out of the Box Supply Chain With
Testing, but adds source and image scanning using Grype.

For workloads that use source code or prebuilt images,
it performs the following:

- Building from source code:

  1. Watching a Git Repository or local directory for changes
  1. Running tests from a developer-provided Tekton pipeline
  1. Scanning the source code for known vulnerabilities using Grype
  1. Building a container image out of the source code with Buildpacks
  1. Scanning the image for known vulnerabilities
  1. Applying operator-defined conventions to the container definition
  1. Deploying the application to the same cluster

- Using a prebuilt application image:

  1. Scanning the image for known vulnerabilities
  1. Applying operator-defined conventions to the container definition
  1. Creating a deliverable object for deploying the application to a cluster


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

To make use this supply chain, ensure:

- [CVE scan results appear in Tanzu Application Platform GUI](../tap-gui/plugins/scc-tap-gui.md#scan)
- Out of the Box Templates is installed.
- Out of the Box Supply Chain With Testing **is NOT installed**.
- Out of the Box Supply Chain With Testing and Scanning **is installed**.
- Developer namespace is configured with the objects per Out of the Box Supply
  Chain With Testing guidance. This supply chain is in addition to the Supply Chain with testing.
- (Optionally) install [Out of the Box Delivery
  Basic](ootb-delivery-basic.html), if you are willing to deploy the application to the
same cluster as the workload and supply chains.

To verify you have the right set of supply chains installed (that is, the
one with scanning and _not_ the one with testing), run:

```console
tanzu apps cluster-supply-chain list
```

```console
NAME                      LABEL SELECTOR
source-test-scan-to-url   apps.tanzu.vmware.com/has-tests=true,apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type=web
source-to-url             apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type=web
```

If you see `source-test-to-url` in the list, the setup is wrong. You **must not
have the _source-test-to-url_ installed** at the same time as
_source-test-scan-to-url_.


## <a id="developer-namespace"></a> Developer Namespace

As mentioned in the prerequisites section, this example builds on the previous
Out of the Box Supply Chain examples, so only additions are included here.

To ensure that you have configured the namespace correctly, it is important that
the namespace has the objects that you configured in the other supply chain setups:

- **registries secrets**: Kubernetes secrets of type
  `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` that contain credentials for pushing and
  pulling the container images built by the supply chain and the
  installation of Tanzu Application Platform.

- **service account**: The identity to be used for any
  interaction with the Kubernetes API made by the supply chain.

- **rolebinding**: Grant to the identity the necessary roles
  for creating the resources prescribed by the supply chain.

  For more information on the preceding objects, see [Out of the Box Supply Chain Basic](ootb-supply-chain-basic.md).

- **Tekton pipeline**: A pipeline runs whenever the supply chain hits the stage
  of testing the source code.

  For more information, see [Out of the Box Supply Chain Testing](ootb-supply-chain-testing.md).

And the new ones, that you create here:

- **scan policy**: Defines what to do with the results taken from scanning the source code and
image produced. For more information, see [ScanPolicy section](#scan-policy).

- **source scan template**: A template of how jobs are created for scanning the source
code. For more information, see [ScanTemplate section](#scan-template).

- **image scan template**: A template of how jobs are created for scanning the image
produced by the supply chain. For more information, see [ScanTemplate section](#scan-template).

Below you will find details about the new objects (compared to Out of the Box
Supply Chain With Testing).


### <a id="updates-to-developer-namespace"></a> Updates to the developer Namespace

For source and image scans, scan templates and scan policies
must exist in the same namespace as the workload. These define:

- `ScanTemplate`: how to run a scan, allowing one to change details about the
  execution of the scan (either for images or source code)

- `ScanPolicy`: how to evaluate whether the artifacts scanned are compliant,
  for example allowing one to be either very strict, or restrictive about particular
vulnerabilities found.

Note that the names of the objects **must** match the ones in the example.


#### <a id="scan-policy"></a> ScanPolicy

The ScanPolicy defines a set of rules to evaluate for a particular scan to
consider the artifacts (image or source code) either compliant or not.

When a ImageScan or SourceScan is created to run a scan, those reference a
policy whose name **must** match the one below (`scan-policy`):

```console
---
apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: ScanPolicy
metadata:
  name: scan-policy
spec:
  regoFile: |
    package main

    # Accepted Values: "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low", "Negligible", "UnknownSeverity"
    notAllowedSeverities := ["Critical","High","UnknownSeverity"]
    ignoreCves := []

    contains(array, elem) = true {
      array[_] = elem
    } else = false { true }

    isSafe(match) {
      fails := contains(notAllowedSeverities, match.ratings.rating[_])
      not fails
    }

    isSafe(match) {
      ignore := contains(ignoreCves, match.Id)
      ignore
    }

    deny[msg] {
      comp := input.bom.components.component[_]
      vuln := comp.vulnerabilities.vulnerability[_]
      ratings := vuln.ratings.rating[_]
      not isSafe(vuln)
      msg = sprintf("CVE %s %s %s", [comp.name, vuln.id, ratings])
    }
```

See [Writing Policy Templates](../scst-scan/policies.md) for more details.


#### <a id="scan-template"></a> ScanTemplate

A ScanTemplate defines the PodTemplateSpec to be used by a Job to run a
particular scan (image or source). When an ImageScan or SourceScan is
instantiated by the supply chain, they reference these templates which must
live in the same namespace as the workload with the names matching the ones
below:

- source scanning (`blob-source-scan-template`)
- image scanning (`private-image-scan-template`)

If you are targeting a namespace that does not match the one configured in the
Tanzu Application Platform profiles, for example if `grype.namespace` is not the same as the one
you are writing the workload to, you can install these in such namespace by making use of the
`tanzu package install` command as described in [Install Supply Chain Security
Tools - Scan](../scst-scan/install-scst-scan.md):

1. Create a file named `ootb-supply-chain-basic-values.yaml` that specifies the corresponding values
to the properties you want to change. For example:

    ```yaml
    grype:
      namespace: YOUR-DEV-NAMESPACE
      targetImagePullSecret: registry-credentials
    ```

1. With the configuration ready, install the templates by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package install grype-scanner \
      --package-name grype.scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version 1.0.0 \
      --namespace YOUR-DEV-NAMESPACE
    ```

>**Note:** Although you can customize the templates, if you are just following the Getting Started
>guide then it is recommended you stick with what is provided in the installation of
>`grype.scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com`. This is created in the same namespace as configured by
>using `grype.namespace` in either Tanzu Application Platform profiles or individual component
>installation as in the earlier example. For more information, see
>[About Source and Image Scans](../scst-scan/explanation.md#about-src-and-image-scans).

#### <a id="multiple-pl"></a> Allow multiple Tekton pipelines in a namespace

You can configure your developer namespace to include more than one pipeline using either of the following methods:

  - Use a single pipeline running on a container image that includes testing tools and runs a common script to execute tests. This allows you to accommodate multiple workloads based in different languages in the same namespace that use a common make test script, as shown in the following example:

    ```
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      name: developer-defined-tekton-pipeline
      labels:
        apps.tanzu.vmware.com/pipeline: test
    spec:
      #...
            steps:
              - name: test
                image: <image_that_has_JDK_and_Go>
                script: |-
                  cd `mktemp -d`
                  wget -qO- $(params.source-url) | tar xvz -m
                  make test
    ```

  - Update the template to include labels that differentiate the pipelines. The configure the labels to differentiate between pipelines, as shown in the following example:

    ```
      selector:
         resource:
           apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
           kind: Pipeline
         matchingLabels:
           apps.tanzu.vmware.com/pipeline: test
    +         apps.tanzu.vmware.com/language: #@ data.values.workload.metadata.labels["apps.tanzu.vmware.com/language"]

    ```

    The following example shows one namespace per-language pipeline:

    ```
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      name: java-tests
      labels:
        apps.tanzu.vmware.com/pipeline: test
        apps.tanzu.vmware.com/language: java
    spec:
      #...
            steps:
              - name: test
                image: gradle
                script: |-
                  # ...
                  ./mvnw test
    ---
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      name: go-tests
      labels:
        apps.tanzu.vmware.com/pipeline: test
        apps.tanzu.vmware.com/language: go
    spec:
      #...
            steps:
              - name: test
                image: golang
                script: |-
                  # ...
                  go test -v ./...
    ```

## <a id="developer-workload"></a> Developer workload

With the ScanPolicy and ScanTemplate objects, with the required names set,
submitted to the same namespace where the workload are submitted, you are ready to submit your workload.

Regardless of the workflow being targeted (local development or gitops), the
workload configuration details are the same as in Out of the Box Supply Chain
Basic, except that you mark the workload as having tests enabled.

For example:

```console
tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
  --git-branch main \
  --git-repo https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app
  --label apps.tanzu.vmware.com/has-tests=true \
  --label app.kubernetes.io/part-of=tanzu-java-web-app \
  --type web
```

```console
Create workload:
      1 + |---
      2 + |apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
      3 + |kind: Workload
      4 + |metadata:
      5 + |  labels:
      6 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: web
      7 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/has-tests: "true"
      8 + |    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: tanzu-java-web-app
      9 + |  name: tanzu-java-web-app
     10 + |  namespace: default
     11 + |spec:
     12 + |  source:
     13 + |    git:
     14 + |      ref:
     15 + |        branch: main
     16 + |      url: https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app
```

## <a id="scan-image-using-snyk"> Scan Image using Snyk

[Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](../scst-scan/install-scst-scan.md) includes an additional integration for running an image scan using Snyk. For information on how to install this integration and how to modify the supply chain template, see [Install Snyk scanner](../scst-scan/install-snyk-integration.md).
