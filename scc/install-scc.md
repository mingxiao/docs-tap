# Install Supply Chain Choreographer

This document describes how to install Supply Chain Choreographer
from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository.

>**Note:** Use the instructions on this page if you do not want to use a profile to install packages.
Both the full and light profiles include Supply Chain Choreographer.
For more information about profiles, see [About Tanzu Application Platform package and profiles](../about-package-profiles.md).

>**Note:** The Supply Chain Choreographer is now bundled with the Cartographer Conventions.
For information on configuring and using Cartographer Conventions, see [Creating conventions](../cartographer-conventions/creating-conventions.md).

Supply Chain Choreographer provides the custom resource definitions the supply chain uses.
Each pre-approved supply chain creates a clear road to production and orchestrates supply chain resources. You can test, build, scan, and deploy. Developers can focus on delivering value to
users. Application operators can rest assured that all code in production has passed
through an approved workflow.

For example, Supply Chain Choreographer passes the results of fetching source code to the component
that builds a container image of it, and then passes the container image
to a component that deploys the image.
