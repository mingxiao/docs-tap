### <a id="environment-page"></a> Environment page

To navigate to the **Environment** page, the user can select the **Environment** option from the
**Information Category** drop-down menu.
The Environment page contains details of the applications' environment.
It contains properties including, but not limited to, system properties, environment variables, and configuration properties (such as application.properties) in a Spring Boot application.

The page includes the following features:

- The UI has search feature that enables the user to search for a property or values.
- Each property has a search icon at the right corner which helps the user quickly see all the occurrences of a specific property key without manually typing in the search field. Clicking the search button trims down the page to that property name.
- The **Refresh Scope** on the top right corner of the page probes the application to refresh all the environment properties.
- The user can edit existing property by clicking the **Override** in the row and editing the value. After the value is saved, the user can see the updated property in the Applied overrides section at the top of the page.
- The **Reset** resets the environment property to the original state
- The user can edit or remove the overridden environment variables in the **Applied Overrides** section.
- The **Applied Overrides** section also enables the user to add new environment properties to the application.

> **Note:** The `management.endpoint.env.post.enabled=true` has to be set in the application config
> properties of the application and a corresponding, editable Environment has to be present in the
> application.

### <a id="memory-page"></a> Memory page

To navigate to the **Memory** page, the user can select the `Memory` option from the `Information Category` drop-down menu.

- The memory page highlights the memory use inside of the JVM. It displays a graphical representation of the different memory regions within heap and non-heap memory. This visualizes data from inside of the JVM (in case of Spring Boot apps running on a JVM) and therefore provides memory insights into the application in contrast to "outside" information about the Kubernetes pod level.
- The real-time graphs displays a stacked overview of the different spaces in memory with the total memory used and total memory size. The page contains graphs to display the GC pauses and GC events. The **Heap Dump** on top right corner allows the user to download heap dump data.

![Memory Page in UI](images/memory.png)

>**Note:** This graphical visualization happens in real time and shows real-time data only.
As mentioned at the top, the Application Live View features do not store any information.
That means the graphs visualize the data over time only for as long as you stay on that page.


### <a id="request-mappings-page"></a> Request Mappings page

To navigate to the Request Mappings page, the user should select the **Request Mappings** option from
the **Information Category** drop-down menu.

This page provides information about the application’s request mappings.
For each of the mapping, it displays the request handler method.
The user can view more details of the request mapping such as header metadata of the application.
That is, it produces, consumes and HTTP method by clicking on the mapping.

The search feature enables the user to search on the request mapping or the method.
The toggle **/actuator/\*\* Request Mappings** displays the actuator related mappings of the application.

>**Note:** When application actuator endpoint is exposed on management.server.port, the application
does not return any actuator request mappings data in the context.
The application displays a message when the actuator toggle is enabled.

The trace data is captured in detail in a tabular format with metrics such as timestamp, method, path,
status, content-type, length, time.

The search feature on the table filters the traces based on the search field value.
The user can view more details of the request such as method, headers, response of the application
by clicking on the timestamp.
The refresh icon above the graph loads the latest traces of the application.
The toggle **/actuator/\*\*** on the top right corner of the page displays the actuator related
traces of the application.
