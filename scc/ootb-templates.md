# Out of the Box Templates

In Cartographer, a supply chain is defined as a directed acyclic graph of
resources choreographed by the Cartographer controllers, with the
definition of the shape of such resources defined by templates.

This package contains a series of reusable templates used by:

* [Out of the Box Supply Chain Basic](ootb-supply-chain-basic.html)
* [Out of the Box Supply Chain with Testing](ootb-supply-chain-testing.html)
* [Out of the Box Supply Chain with Testing and Scanning](ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning.html)

As a prerequisite of the Out of the Box Supply Chains, you must install this package to have
Workloads delivered properly.
