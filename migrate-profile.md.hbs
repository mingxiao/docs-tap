# Migrate Tanzu Application Platform profiles

This document describes how to migrate from one Tanzu Application Platform profile to another.

You can install Tanzu Application Platform by following the instructions in [Installing Tanzu Application Platform](install-intro.md).

## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

To migrate from one Tanzu Application Platform profile to another ensure you do the following:

- Install Tanzu Application Platform. See [Install your Tanzu Application Platform profile](install.md#install-profile)
- Install or update the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins. See [Install or update the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins](install-tanzu-cli.md#cli-and-plugin)
If you install Tanzu Application Platform GUI verify the considerations. See [Tanzu Application Platform GUI Considerations](tap-gui/upgrades.md#considerations)
- Verify all packages are reconciled by running `tanzu package installed list -A`
- Note which packages are included in the original profile and the profile migrated to. If the profile you are migrating to includes additional packages, those will be added and additional cluster resources may be needed. If the profile migrated to doesn't include a component, the package is removed. If you do not want to add or remove a package, consider adding an additional cluster instead of migrating.

## <a id="add-new-package-repo"></a> Add new package repository

Follow these steps to add the new package repository:

1. Add the latest version of the Tanzu Application Platform package repository by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository update tanzu-tap-repository \
        --url registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages:TAP-VERSION  \
        --namespace tap-install
    ```

    Where `TAP-VERSION` is your Tanzu Application Platform version. For example, `{{ vars.tap_version }}`.

2. Add the new package repository by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    ```
## <a id="edit-profile-values"></a> Edit the tap-values.yaml configuration file that was used during installation

During the Tanzu Application Platform installation, a configuration file is built that contains the necessary configuration values related to the Tanzu Application Platform cluster. [See Installing the Tanzu Application Platform package and profiles](install.md#install-profile). To change the profile, edit the `profile` key in this file, typically saved as `tap-values.yaml` by running:

```yaml
profile: PROFILE-NAME
```
Where `PROFILE-NAME` is the desired target profile. Review the documentation on profiles to determine the best fit.

## <a id="perform-migration"></a> Perform migration of Tanzu Application Platform profile

 This step will execute the actual migration that will result in the addition or removal of components based on the selected profile. Consideration should be given to backup any data that may be lost as part of this operation.

To complete the Tanzu Application Platform profile migration, do the following:

```console
tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v TAP-VERSION  --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
```

Where `TAP-VERSION` is your Tanzu Application Platform version. For example, `{{ vars.tap_version }}`.
