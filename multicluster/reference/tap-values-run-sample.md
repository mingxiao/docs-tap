# Run profile

The following is the YAML file sample for the run-profile:

```yaml
profile: run
ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to true. Not a string.

shared:
  ingress_domain: INGRESS-DOMAIN

supply_chain: basic

contour:
  envoy:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer #NodePort can be used if your Kubernetes cluster doesn't support LoadBalancing

appliveview_connector:
  backend:
    sslDisabled: TRUE-OR-FALSE-VALUE
    host: appliveview.VIEW-CLUSTER-INGRESS-DOMAIN
```

Where:

- `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain for the host name that you point at the `tanzu-shared-ingress`
service's external IP address.
- `VIEW-CLUSTER-INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain you setup on the View profile cluster. This matches the value key `appliveview.ingressDomain` or `shared.ingress_domain` on the view cluster. Include the default host name `appliveview.` ahead of the domain.
