# Logs messages and reasons

Log messages follow a JSON format. Each log can contain the following keys:

| Key        | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| level      | Log level |
| ts         | Timestamp |
| logger     | Name of the logger component which provided the log message |
| msg        | Log message |
| object     | Relevant object that triggered the log message |
| error      | A message for the error.<br> Only present with "error" log level |
| stacktrace | A stacktrace for where the error occured.<br> Only present with error level |

The possible log messages the webhook emits and their explanations are summarized in the following table:
